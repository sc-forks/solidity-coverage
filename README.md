### Code coverage for Solidity testing
![coverage example](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uum8t-31bUaa6dTRVVhj6w.png)

+ For more details about what this is, how it works and potential limitations, see 
[the accompanying article](https://blog.colony.io/code-coverage-for-solidity-eecfa88668c2).
+ `solidity-coverage` is in development and **its accuracy is unknown.** If you
find discrepancies between the coverage report and your suite's behavior, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues).
+ `solidity-coverage` is [Solcover](https://github.com/JoinColony/solcover)

### Install

Run the following command in a Truffle based application or the root directory of your solidity project.

```
$ npm install --save-dev solidity-coverage
```

### Run

The command will be run from within your application project, for each project, you will have to install solidity-coverage.

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/solidity-coverage
```

Tests run signficantly slower while coverage is being generated. A 1 to 2 minute delay
between the end of Truffle compilation and the beginning of test execution is possible if your
test suite is large. Large Solidity files can also take a while to instrument.

### Network Configuration

By default, solidity-coverage generates a stub `truffle.js` that accomodates its special gas needs and
connects to a modified version of testrpc on port 8555. If your tests will run on the development network
using a standard `truffle.js` and testrpc instance, you shouldn't have to do any configuration. If your tests depend on logic or special options added to `truffle.js` you should declare a coverage network there following the example below.

**Example**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" 
    },
    coverage: {
      host: "localhost",
      network_id: "*",
      port: 8555,         // <-- If you change this, also set the port option in .solcover.js.  
      gas: 0xfffffffffff, // <-- Use this high gas value 
      gasPrice: 0x01      // <-- Use this low gas price
    },
    ...etc...
  }
};
```
### Options

You can also create a `.solcover.js` config file in the root directory of your project and specify
additional options if necessary:

**Example:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
    port: 6545,
    testrpcOptions: '-p 6545 -u 0x54fd80d6ae7584d8e9a19fe1df43f04e5282cc43',
    testCommand: 'mocha --timeout 5000',
    norpc: true,
    dir: './secretDirectory',
    skipFiles: ['Routers/EtherRouter.sol']
};
```


| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| accounts | *Number* | 35 | Number of accounts to launch testrpc with. |
| port   | *Number* | 8555 | Port to run testrpc on / have truffle connect to |
| norpc | *Boolean* | false | Prevent solidity-coverage from launching its own testrpc. Useful if you are managing a complex test suite with a [shell script](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/ed872ca0a11c4926f8bb91dd103bea1378a3384c/scripts/coverage.sh) |
| testCommand | *String* | `truffle test` |  Run an arbitrary test command. ex: `mocha --timeout 5000`. NB: Also set the `port` option to whatever your tests require (probably 8545). |
| testrpcOptions | *String* | `--port 8555` | options to append to a command line invocation of testrpc. NB: Using this overwrites the defaults so always specify a port in this string *and* in the `port` option |
| copyNodeModules | *Boolean* | false | Copies `node_modules` into the coverage environment. May significantly increase the time for coverage to complete if enabled. Useful if your contracts import solidity files from an npm installed package. | 
| skipFiles | *Array* | `['Migrations.sol']` | Array of contracts (with paths expressed relative to the `contracts` directory) that should be skipped when doing instrumentation. `Migrations.sol` is skipped by default, and does not need to be added to this configuration option if it is used. |
| dir | *String* | `.` | Solidity-coverage copies all the assets in your root directory (except `node_modules`) to a special folder where it instruments the contracts and executes the tests. `dir` allows you to define a relative path from the root directory to those assets. Useful if your contracts & tests are within their own folder as part of a larger project.|
